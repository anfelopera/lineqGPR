# lineqGPR
## Gaussian processes regression models with linear inequality constraints

**Description:**
  *lineqGPR* is a package for Gaussian process interpolation, regression and
  simulation under linear inequality constraints based on (López-Lopera et
  al., 2017). The constrained models are given as objects with "lineqGP" S3
  class. Implementations according to (Maatouk and Bay, 2017) are also
  provided as objects with "lineqDGP" S3 class.

**Note:**
  *lineqGPR* was developed within the frame of the Chair in Applied
  Mathematics OQUAIDO, gathering partners in technological research (BRGM,
  CEA, IFPEN, IRSN, Safran, Storengy) and academia (CNRS, Ecole Centrale
  de Lyon, Mines Saint-Etienne, University of Grenoble, University of Nice,
  University of Toulouse) around advanced methods for Computer Experiments.
